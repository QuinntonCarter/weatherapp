- refactor data through out app x
- style with npm package x
- maybe make cute like old weather weather channel

- configure for tailwind full styling (font sizes, responsive, etc)

- don't use cache for data mapping x

NOT MVP

- drag and drop extended forecast windows.. maybe just convert to using react95
