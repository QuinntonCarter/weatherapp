- refactor data through out app
- style with npm package
- maybe make cute like old weather weather channel

- configure for tailwind full styling (font sizes, responsive, etc)

- don't use cache for data mapping x

NOT MVP

- drag and drop extended forecast windows
- try importing celestial bodies component(s) from nasa image viewer
- if works, use post processing pixelate filter => can use on forecast cards
